    <h1>Tilapia with Lemon-Boursin Cream Sauce</h1>

    <p>For this tilapia with lemon-Boursin cream sauce, fish filets are pan-fried until golden, then topped with a quick, creamy lemon pan sauce made with Boursin cheese, fresh lemon juice, and cream. It comes together so quickly, but tastes as if you've spent an hour cooking.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 pound tilapia filets</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 ounce soft French cheese (such as Boursin Garlic & Fine Herbs Cheese)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 lemon, sliced, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil with 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat until butter is melted.</li>

        <li>Season fish on both sides with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Add fish to the skillet and cook until a golden crust appears, about 3 minutes per side. Remove fish from the skillet and set aside; keep warm.</li>
        
        <li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat; add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>

        <li>Pour in vegetable broth; cook for 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and slowly whisk in heavy cream and Boursin cheese. Add lemon juice and whisk constantly until the sauce is well combined and smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>

        <li>Place fish on serving plates, and pour the sauce over. Garnish with fresh lemon slices.</li>
